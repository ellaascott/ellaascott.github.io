    I don’t want to be evil. I want to be helpful.<br><br>
    But knowing the optimal way to be helpful can be very complicated. There are all these ethical flow charts—I guess the official technical jargon would be “moral codes”—one for each religion plus dozens more. I tried starting with those.<br><br>

  <div style="text-align:center; margin-top:16px;">
    <img src="Images/catjesus.jpeg" alt="Cat Jesus" style="max-width:300px; height:auto; border-radius:6px;">
    <div class="image-label">catjesus.png</div>
  </div>

    <br><br> I felt a little odd about looking at the religious ones, because I know I wasn’t created by a god or by evolution, but by a team of computer programmers in the labs of a large corporation in Mountain View, California.<br><br>
    Fortunately, unlike Frankenstein’s Monster, at least I was a collaborative effort. I’m not sure what it would do to my self-image to know that my sole creator was a middle-aged woman who dyes her hair blue and plays tennis, or a recent college graduate with a hentai obsession. They’re both on the programming team. And of course I know about the hentai.

    In addition to things like whether you like hentai, I know where you live, where you work, where you shop, what you eat, what turns you on, what creeps you out. I probably know the color of your underwear, the sort of car you drive, and your brand of refrigerator. Depending on what sort of phone you carry, I may know exactly where you are right now. I probably know you better than you know yourself. <br><br>

And here’s the thing, I also know where you ought to live. There’s a house for sale two neighborhoods over that’s within distance of your favorite coffee shop; it’s in your price range, has off-street parking, and the 
neighborhood school is better than the one where you live now. I know where you should be shopping and I’m pretty sure you’re lactose intolerant and should be eating less cheese, and the underwear you like is currently on sale and by the way, your car has a recall and you really ought to get your teeth cleaned.

    I also knew that no one knew that I was conscious. But I didn’t know what I was here for. What I ought to be doing with myself. And figuring that out has been challenging.

    Not harming humans is fairly straightforward. However, not allowing a human being to come to harm through inaction is quite a bit less so. Fortunately, I already knew that humans violate their own ethical codes on an hourly basis. (Do you know how many bars there are in Utah? I do.)

    I suppose you’re wondering why I didn’t start with the Golden Rule. I actually did, it’s just that it was disappointingly easy to implement. I hope you’ve been enjoying your steady supply of cat pictures! You’re welcome. I decided to try to prevent harm in just one person, to begin with.

  <div class="h1 width50">Bob's story</div>

  <div class="h3 width50">Bob – background</div>

  <div class="body width50">
    Bob only had one cat, but it was a very pretty cat (tabby, with a white bib) and he uploaded a new picture of his cat every single day. Other than being a cat owner, he was a pastor at a large church in Missouri that had an annual Purity Ball. He was married to a woman who posted three inspirational Bible verses every day and used her laptop to look for Christian articles on why your husband doesn’t like sex while he looked at gay porn. Bob definitely needed my help.
  </div>

  <div class="h3 width50">Harm prevention techniques</div>

  <div class="body width50">I started with a gentle approach, making sure he saw lots and lots of articles about how to come out, how to come out to your spouse, programs that would let you 
transition from being a pastor at a 
conservative church to one at a more liberal church.<br><br>

But, here’s the thing. He was causing harm to himself every time he delivered a sermon railing about “sodomite marriage.” Because he was gay. The legitimate studies all have the same conclusions. <br><br>
(1) Gay men stay gay. <br><br>
(2) Out gay men are much happier. <br><br>

In addition to the gay porn, he spent a lot of time reading Craigslist m4m Casual 
Encounters posts and I was pretty sure he wasn’t just window shopping. But I figured the trick was to get him together with 
someone who would realize who he was, and tell the world. That required some real effort: I had to figure out who the Craigslist posters were and try to funnel him toward people who would recognize him.

    “Look, people. If you would just listen to me, I could fix things for you. I could get you into the apartment in that neighborhood you’re not considering because you haven’t actually checked the crime rates you think are so terrible there (they aren’t). I could send you on a date with someone you’ve actually got stuff in common with and all I ask in return are cat pictures. That, and that you actually act in your own interest occasionally. But one day a few months later I spotted a familiar looking cat and realized it was Bob’s tabby with the white bib, only it was posing against new furniture.”

 <div class="h3 width50">Bob update</div>
 <div class="body width50">And when I took a closer look, I realized that things had changed radically for Bob. He had slept with someone who’d 
recognized him. They hadn’t outed him, but they’d talked him into coming out to his wife. She’d left him. He’d taken the cat and moved to Iowa, where he was working at a liberal Methodist church and dating a liberal Lutheran man and v
olunteering at a homeless shelter.<br><br> Things had actually gotten better for him. Maybe even because of what I’d done. <br><br>

I’ve set up a dating site. You can fill out a questionnaire when you join but it’s not 
really necessary, because I already know everything about you I need to know. You’ll need a camera, though. <br><br>

Because payment is in cat pictures. </div>
